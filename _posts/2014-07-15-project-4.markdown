description: A National Homebuilder was in need of a modern Cape Dutch inspired single family residence to add in to their offerings for a community in Naples Florida. This design was created based on a preexisting floorplan and elevated the exterior space by creating a courtyard that extends outdoor living and celebrates the front of the home.
