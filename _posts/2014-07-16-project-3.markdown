description: A client ordered the design of a gymnasium for the Colombian compensation fund, Comfenalco on a highly irregular terrain of his ownership with the objective of detonating dynamics in the sector, particularly to sell the rest of the lots included in the terrain. Other important objectives were to occupy the terrain's square footage despite its irregular topography and to meet the needs of Comfenalco's new gym. On one side, an elementary school endangered the proposal with audio and visual contamination for the gymnasium; and on the other, the afternoon sun endangered with overheating the building.

Restraints were encountered when dividing the terrain. A portion of the terrain was to be destined for the Gymnasium and the rest would be for future retail. The Gym location had to be directly in contact with the Avenue, not occupy the whole East side of the terrain and comply with minimum space requirements. Therefore, the building is oriented East-West, focusing visuals towards the green landscape. The North facade is closed towards the neighboring school, but offers openings towards the morning sun and lush landscape. The South facade is a glass opening filtered by local bamboo to avoid the afternoon sun for energy efficiency. The West fa√ßade opens to the rear visuals and offers openings planning for future constructions.
