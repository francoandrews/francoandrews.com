With an Architecture Degree from La Universidad La Gran Colombia in Colombia, and a Masterâ€™s Degree in Architecture from the University of Florida U.S.A., Christian has worked at firms in Armenia Colombia, Istanbul Turkey and Atlanta U.S.A. His diverse international background has given him a broad sense of design, and having studied diverse architectural styles and movements that have come and gone throughout the centuries Christian has a particular insight in regards to beauty, proportion and construction techniques. But, at the core of his work one thing remains a constant: the client. He believes that Architecture, before obeying to an established set of stylistic norms and rules, must celebrate its user. </p>
